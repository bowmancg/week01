# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- I am starting to get a lot better with Git, which will undoubtedly help me learn it as a reflex. Which leads me to what I'm not so good at: Bootstrap. It's a good thing it has a docs page, which will help since there's so much to reference. Learning to clone a webpage is a step in the right direction at least, so I won't be completely lost as long as I keep referencing my work.
