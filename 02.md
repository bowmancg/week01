## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

- A pseudo-class in CSS essentially gives a selector a specific element to call on within the selector itself. Pseudo-classes such as hover or checked for example, will be useful for building contact information pages.

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

- Specificity is a term used to describe how the functions of certain selectors take precedence over others. If a p tag is selected to have a font size of 32px first and a another selector gives the same tag 24px, then the first selector(32px) will overrule the second. This built-in function will keep the CSS in an understandable format where none of the selectors will target the same element.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

- The !important feature will overrule any other selector that may try to access the same element. If it gets used excessively, then it may nullify other selectors used in the stylesheet.
