## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***? 

- Wireframing creates the initial skeleton of a webpage; basically the first prototype. They can be fast and easy to create which is why they are often used as a comparison reference to the webpage being built.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wireframes, and why is each one useful?

- There are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity wireframes and each one is distinguished by the details they contain. Low-fidelity is best used during meetings to decide on a concept, mid-fidelity is used for more precise layouts, and high-fidelity should be used to produce the final concept design.

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- Wireframes should always be used to sketch out any kind of detailed site. Designing anything without a reference can be difficult at best, especially if there's no clear vision on the end product.
